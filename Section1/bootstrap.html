                <h2>Sub Heading</h2>
                <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the
                    centre
                    of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced
                    on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls"
                    (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over"
                    being completed once they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at each
                    end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike
                    the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs when either the bowler unfairly bowls the ball to
                    the batter, the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or the two batters swap ends of the pitch,
                    which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each batter
                    (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means of dismissal include being
                    bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side
                    either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a
                    batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have
                    been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. At the end of the game, the team that
                    scored more runs wins, provided
                    that the other team has completed its one or two scheduled innings. The game is adjudicated by two
                    umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.</p>
